    "shortdescription": "Earth is a fluid-width 2 column theme based on Binarius, for Moodle 2.x. It is part of a series of ten 'Planet' themes intended to provide a choice of visually accessible and/or fun colour schemes.\r\n\r\nEarth is designed to provide a lower contrast interface for reading while maintaining clear visibility. It also includes a version of the MoodleBar developed by Lewis Carr, and uses the autohide functionality for course editing buttons outlined by Frankie Kam. The auto-hide means that editing buttons are only visible when you rollover them with editing on, reducing screen clutter.",
