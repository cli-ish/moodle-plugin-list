    "shortdescription": "MultiLayout is a theme with minimal styling which enables various 1, 2 or 3 column page layouts to be used from within the single layout file with little recoding (one line to be uncommented). It is intended to be used as a parent theme for further styling (in the same manner as Base/Standard) rather than as a complete site theme on its own.\r\nAlongside the multiple layouts, it also has additional block regions above and below main content to provide maximum flexibility for the layout of any page.",
