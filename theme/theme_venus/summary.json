It is part of a series of ten 'Planet' themes intended to provide a choice of visually accessible and/or fun colour schemes.\r\n\r\nVenus is designed to provide a fun, high contrast interface, and in one word would be described as PINK. It also includes a 2.4 compatible version of the MoodleBar developed by Lewis Carr, and uses the autohide functionality for course editing buttons outlined by Frankie Kam.",
