    "shortdescription": "The presence of this block on gradebook and some other pages will blur the names, email addresses, and images of students - e.g., in both the Grader and User Reports; and it will do the same for names in Moodle core's Forum, and in the Choice module, as well. This protection of student privacy allows for more FERPA-friendly sharing among faculty. ",
