    "shortdescription": "Not always logged in, you want to be up to date about new content, discussions or events in your Moodle courses? This moodle block implements a solution that periodically notifies learners about new content or activities included into a Moodle course. This solution will act as a sentinel that detects whether new contents or new activities have been included into the Moodle course, and notify the learners and/or the instructors about that. Notifications methods are:\r\n\r\n    e-mail message\r\n    RSS aggregator\r\n    SMS message\r\n\r\nThere is also a version of this plugin for Moodle 1.9 that can be downloaded from the Website.",
