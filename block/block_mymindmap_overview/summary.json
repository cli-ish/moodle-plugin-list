    "shortdescription": "The mymindmap_overview block presents the courses in the dashboard.\r\nBlock mymindmap_overview has the advantage of seeing all its courses containing at least one module on a single screen zone and being able to navigate to the section, the activity or the chosen resource to access it.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT! For a better view of the mindmap of your courses, put this block in the content column\r\n\r\nThis view also shows how many modules constitute a course or section, which allows you to only go to courses offering content.\r\nThis plugin uses jsmind javascript tool to design the schemas. You can find it here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/hizzgdev/jsmind\r\n\r\nThere are some slowdowns due to searching the logs table for each student and each course needed to show the red flag.\r\nTo avoid this, you can replace the \"block_mymindmap_overview\" file with the \"block_mymindmap_overview-without-flags\" file by removing the \"-without-flags\" extension.\r\n\r\nIn the last version, all calls to the \"logs\" table to control access to new activities are avoided in order to speed up the display of the mindmap",
