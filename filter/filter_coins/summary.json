    "shortdescription": "The point of the filter is to automatically link from citations to the full-text of articles online, using the OpenURL mechanism. One of the easiest ways to get COinS data into a Moodle page is to drag and drop a citation from the Zotero citation management software into the Moodle html editor. As long as Zotero is configured to 'Copy as HTML' in the 'Quick Copy' setting, this will include a COinS and formatted reference when you drag and drop into an HTML editor.",
