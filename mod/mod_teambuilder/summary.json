    "shortdescription": "Developed by UNSW, this is an advanced tool for building teams based off a set of criteria. You ask your students some questions, and then develop a predicate based off their answers for your teams. This is great if you want a little more control than \"Assign Randomly\" but less work than \"Manual Allocation\".",
