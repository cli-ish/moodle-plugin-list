    "shortdescription": "Allows a course creator to add upload a large pdf file and serve only a specified page range back to the users. This has been useful in serving specific portions of a larger \"book of readings\" type of PDF files to students in remote locations without high speed internet access. It may also be used as a way to dissect a pdf document for electronic delivery where a page or pages at the beginning or end of the document are not relevant to the end user. ",
