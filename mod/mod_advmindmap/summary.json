    "shortdescription": "This is a modification of the original Mindmap module for moodle formerly found on ekpenso.com. \r\n\r\nThis Advance Mindmap module allows you to create mindmapping activity in moodle.\r\n\r\nAdded features include:\r\n- Every user now have a separate mindmap in one single activity, with links to view others' mindmap.\r\n- Dummy group mode: multiple mindmaps with simple group name that everyone can view and edit (for group mindmapping without having to setup groups in the course) \r\n- Lock mindmap: prevent editing of mindmap when someone is editing it during group mindmapping\r\n\r\nCurrently, it is not backward compatible with Moodle 1.9x, please install it on Moodle 2.x only.",
