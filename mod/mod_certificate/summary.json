Only bug fixes are being applied. I have been working on a new plugin which can be located at https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_customcert which allows complete customisation of the PDF via the browser, whereas this plugin requires FTP and PHP knowledge. Both plugins can be installed on a site at once with no issues.",
