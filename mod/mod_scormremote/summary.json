    "shortdescription": "This is a Moodle activity module completely independent from mod_scorm which allows you to upload a scorm and then serve it remotely to other learning management systems on other domains using a thin scorm wrapper. This allows you to upgrade the scorm in place remotely and also allows you to manage and enforce seat counts and limits.",
